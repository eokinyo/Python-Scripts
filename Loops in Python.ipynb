    "Question 1: Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    # Line of code.\n",
    "        # Line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: Create a while loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "while x < 11:\n",
    "    # Line of code.\n",
    "        # Line of code.\n",
    "    # Line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Create a program with a for loop and a break statement. The program should iterate over characters in an email address, exit the loop when it reaches the @ symbol, and print the part before @ on one line. Use the skeleton below:\n",
    "\n",
    "for ch in \"john.smith@pythoninstitute.org\":\n",
    "    if ch == \"@\":\n",
    "        # Line of code.\n",
    "    # Line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: Create a program with a for loop and a continue statement. The program should iterate over a string of digits, replace each 0 with x, and print the modified string to the screen. Use the skeleton below:\n",
    "\n",
    "for digit in \"0165031806510\":\n",
    "    if digit == \"0\":\n",
    "        # Line of code.\n",
    "        # Line of code.\n",
    "    # Line of code.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "n = 3\n",
    " \n",
    "while n > 0:\n",
    "    print(n + 1)\n",
    "    n -= 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(n)\n",

    "\n",
    "n = range(4)\n",
    " \n",
    "for num in n:\n",
    "    print(num - 1)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",

    "\n",
    "for i in range(0, 6, 3):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
